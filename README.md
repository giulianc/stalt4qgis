A learning tool fo spherical trigonometry

This is a tool for learning the Spherical Trigonometry as explained by I.Todhunter and J.G.Leathem in McMillan, London, 1914.

I want to build this tool to learn the spherical trigonometry that I needed to know in detail the transformation of geographical coordinates.

He is currently a standalone procedure to manage configurations of spherical points, vectors, circles, arcs, triangles, etc..

Currently I have implemented the basic functions and propositions described by the authors in the first 43 paragraphs.

I think, at the end of the path, to configure it as a plugin for QGIS in the hope god contribute to its spread in educational environment.

I published a small presentation on http://www.slideshare.net/giulianc/spherical-trigonometry.

I hope I can be of help to someone; any advice, support or criticism are welcome.

t.i.a., best regards,
giuliano curti
